Thanks for the clarity, Geeta. Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

⸻

⚠️ Situation Recap
	•	✅ Apache 2.4.54 + ModSecurity2 was working on RHEL 7.
	•	🔼 OS was upgraded to RHEL 8.
	•	❌ Now Apache fails to start with:

Cannot load module mod_security2.so into server: liblua-5.1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory



⸻

🧠 Why This Happens
	•	mod_security2.so was built against Lua 5.1 on RHEL 7.
	•	RHEL 8 no longer includes Lua 5.1 by default.
	•	Your old binary is incompatible due to missing libraries or linker issues.

⸻

✅ Fix Options (Choose One)

🛠 Option 1: Reinstall Lua 5.1 (Quick Fix)

sudo dnf install compat-lua compat-lua-devel

Check if the file exists:

ls /usr/lib64/liblua-5.1.so*

Then reload linker:

sudo ldconfig

Try restarting Apache:

sudo systemctl restart httpd

If that works: ✅ you’re good.

⸻

🛠 Option 2: Rebuild mod_security2 on RHEL 8 (Best Practice)

Why? Because even if you install Lua 5.1, your mod_security2.so was compiled on RHEL 7 and may link to outdated glibc or Apache headers.

Here’s the process:

🔧 Install Build Dependencies

sudo dnf install git gcc make httpd-devel pcre-devel curl-devel libxml2-devel \
                 compat-lua compat-lua-devel yajl-devel lmdb-devel autoconf \
                 automake libtool

📥 Clone and Build

cd /usr/local/src
git clone -b v2/master https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity
cd ModSecurity
./build.sh
./configure --with-lua
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install

📂 Replace Old Module

Copy the new .so:

sudo cp /usr/local/modsecurity/lib/mod_security2.so /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/

Make sure this line exists in your config:

LoadModule security2_module modules/mod_security2.so

Then restart:

sudo systemctl restart httpd


⸻

🧪 Optional: Temporarily Disable ModSecurity to Get Apache Running

If you want Apache running while you fix the module:

sudo sed -i 's/^LoadModule security2_module/#LoadModule security2_module/' /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-base.conf
sudo systemctl restart httpd


⸻

✅ Summary

Fix Type	Recommended When	Action
Reinstall Lua 5.1	You want a quick fix	dnf install compat-lua
Rebuild mod_security2	You want a clean, future-proof setup	Follow build steps
Disable ModSecurity	You’re troubleshooting or don’t need WAF now	Comment out LoadModule
