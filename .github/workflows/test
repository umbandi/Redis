Hi [Manager’s Name], I’m Geeta, and I bring 22 years of experience in IT, primarily focused on platform engineering, DevOps, and automation. My key technical strengths include Redis, TAS, TKGI, OpenShift, and advanced automation through Bash and Python scripting. In my previous roles, I’ve led and contributed to complex Redis and TAS deployments, worked on TKGI platform optimization, and automated several processes to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning Ansible, Harness, and HashiCorp Vault to deepen my expertise in modern CI/CD pipelines, configuration management, and secrets management. I’m looking forward to applying my experience here, learning about the team’s challenges, and contributing to impactful projects while continuing to grow professionally."
